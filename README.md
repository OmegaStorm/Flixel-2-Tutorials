>Back in 2010-2011, I created a few ActionScript tutorials using a game framework called Flixel created by Adam Saltsman. Nothing helps you more than trying to help others after all. Each tutorial part was placed into its own repository, which was silly looking back, but I was new to Git at the time. 
>
>Anyways, since Flash is long dead, I figure a little spring cleaning is in order, but I still wanted to keep the code for posterity. This repository is each of those merged into one, while keeping the commit history, even if they only had a single commit each. Each part is now in its own directory.

*Below is a description of each tutorial*

Codename Gradius - Flixel 2 Tutorial Extended
------

Shoot Em Up - Part 1
------

This tutorial was part of a ground up experience that included installing your development environment and an old fashioned Hello World. It was more or less meant to be a replacement for the previous tutorial, though it never got a part 2.

This project was compiled against Flixel v2.53 (and tested with 2.43), Flex SDK 4.1 and Flash Player 10.2. It also includes Flixel 2.53 source files by Adam Saltsman.
